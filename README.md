1. Language Processing Pipeline for Micro-Haskell


    The project illustrates all stages of the language processing pipeline for program-
    ming languages, taking us from a source le, written in MH, to execution of the program.
    In our case, the pipeline has four stages: lexing, parsing, typechecking and evaluation.


2. Natural Language Query System in Python/NLTK


    This project builds a system that uses Python and NLTK to construct a system that reads
    simple facts (in a KB) and then answers questions about them.
